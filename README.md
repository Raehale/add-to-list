##  Description

### What does this do?
This app allows the user to input items and create an interactive shopping lis. They are able to remove items from the list by tapping on the elements.

### Why did I do this?
This is my first project built with Firebase. I learned how to store data, grab a snapshot, and itterate through needed data.
I use it to keep track of my personal tasks

## Using this project
This project is open source. You can reproduce it by forking the project and creating your own Firebase account.

## Prerequisites
- git
- node 16+

## Use List App
To use this app be sure to fork it to your own repo and use your own Firebase. You will need to deploy the site and add it as a saved browser link to your phone so it is like an app.

## Help
If you need any help in getting this project to work on your own machine, feel free to email <alyssarae98ha@gmail.com>. Or create an issue on this repo.
